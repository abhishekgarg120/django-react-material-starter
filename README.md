# Django React Material-UI starter

This is a very simple example of how you can quickly start a Django project with react where you don't want to go with a
setup or compilers like webpack.

Django's settings are at their defaults with minimun changes. If you are using this example, please always update your
passwords and settings.

### Requirements
```shell
Python 3
django 3

# Optional if you want to use JSX,
Nodejs
npm install @babel/cli
npm install @babel/core
npm install @babel/preset-react

# User the following bash to convert jsx to js
bash jsx_to_js.sh


```
